Adobe has released for general availability Quality Patches Tool (QPT) - a tool that  allows for applying, reverting, and viewing general information about quality patches available for your installed version of Magento Commerce (for both on-premises and cloud).

QPT provides faster self-service issue resolution, allowing you to easily apply patches suggested by Magento Support for issues you might experience with Magento.

>![info]
>
>Note:  QPT should be used as a tool to pull in necessary quality fixes as needed on a case-by-case basis only and not as a long-term approach to maintaining Magento code. Upgrading to the latest version of Magento is still the best method for resolution of quality issues and should be prioritized.

## Get and use Quality Patches Tool

QPT is delivered as a composer package.  For Magento Commerce hosted on cloud, the package is included in the ECE-Tools package.

Having installed the tool, you can check for available patches, apply or revert them any time.
