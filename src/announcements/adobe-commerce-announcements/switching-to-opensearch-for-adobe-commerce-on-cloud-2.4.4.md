Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.4.4 will not support versions of ElasticSearch after 7.10. You must switch to OpenSearch 1.2.x before upgrading to 2.4.4. Adobe will provide detailed instructions closer to the 2.4.4 GA release.

Adobe Commerce is adding support for Elastic Search 7.16 and OpenSearch 1.2 in all March 2022 patch releases (2.4.4, 2.4.3-p2,2.3.7-p3). In 2.4.4, Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure will move to OpenSearch as the default search engine, so merchants must use OpenSearch in place of ElasticSearch before upgrading to 2.4.4 or later. Merchants with Adobe Commerce on-premises deployments can use ElasticSearch or OpenSearch because Adobe Commerce will continue to support both.

 **What is OpenSearch?**  

OpenSearch is a fork of ElasticSearch and Kibana. Maintained by AWS instead of Elastic.co. To learn more review GitHub [opensearch-project/OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch).

**What is the purpose and *benefit* of this change? Does it reduce security risks? Are there cost benefits?**

We cannot use ES anymore due to license changes. However, despite these changes the technology being used remains the same.

**Compatibility across versions**

**Will Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure support 7.10?**

Yes - starting mid-Jan.

**For Adobe Commerce on-premises, will we skip 7.10 and go straight to 7.16.1?**

7.10 should already work there but 7.16.1 is the only non-vulnerable release after Log4j, so we recommend 7.16.1.

**Migration**

**When can merchants migrate to OpenSearch?**

After Adobe Commerce 2.4.4.

**What can merchants (Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure and Adobe Commerce on-premises) who are not on 2.4.4 do? Can they upgrade to a supported version of Elasticsearch (7.10, 7.16.1) or to OpenSearch? Do they have to be on the latest supported version to do so (like 2.3.7-p2, 2.4.3-p1)?**

 If the Adobe Commerce core version they are on supports ES 7.10 â€“ they can use it. Review [System Requirements](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/system-requirements.html) in our develoepr documentation for version compatibility.
