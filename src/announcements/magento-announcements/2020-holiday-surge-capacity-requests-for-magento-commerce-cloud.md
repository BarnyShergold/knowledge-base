During the peak holiday sales season (approximately Mid-November through Mid-January), Magento recommends that all Commerce customers hosted on our Cloud infrastructure prepare for increased traffic.

 **Planning and Estimating Traffic**  

We recommend that all Commerce customers [utilize this set of recommendations on how to estimate peak season traffic](https://magento.com/blog/best-practices/four-p%E2%80%99s-peak-season-performance-guide-preparing-your-infrastructure-high) in 2020.

Once you have completed the recommended estimation, if your team has identified any dates where you feel you will need additional capacity, continue on to the next step for information on how to request surge capacity.

 **Requesting Surge Capacity**  

Commerce customers that anticipate a need for additional capacity during the holiday season should [submit a Surge Capacity Support Ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041138511-How-to-request-temporary-additional-cloud-capacity-for-Magento-Commerce-Cloud) via our [Help Center](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us) , â€¯indicating the dates and expected capacity needs within the ticket. Please note that increased capacity will require usage of your licensed overage capacity.

We recommend submitting these tickets at least 48 business hours in advance of when the capacity is needed; and additionally recommend that requests for the Black Friday / Cyber Monday period be placed as far in advance as possible, as capacity during this period is limited.
