Magento is performing routine maintenance on our Magento.com family of sites during the period of March 6-8, 2020. This work may make the following sites and services temporarily unavailable:

* Magento.com My Account Pages
* Help Center and Support Tickets
* Magento U Training & Certification
* Magento Partner Portal
* Magento Forums
* Magento Marketplace

If any development, training, or deployments that you or your team are engaged in rely on one of the resources listed above, we recommend reviewing these dates and planning accordingly.

During this maintenance period, if you or your team requires support for a P1 issue that you would typically resolve by submitting a support ticket, please contact us via our P1 Hotline. See the [Magento P1 hotline](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042536151) article for P1 hotline phone numbers (log in is required to view the article).

## ** *Partner and Developer Project Access During Maintenance* ** 

Partners and developers can still access on-going projects during the maintenance period via [accounts.magento.cloud/user](https://accounts.magento.cloud/user) . In order to access this feature, you will need to know the relevant password for the project.

You can manage your password ahead of the maintenance window at [accounts.magento.cloud/user](https://accounts.magento.cloud/user) via the **Account Settings** page.
