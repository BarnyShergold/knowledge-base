The SQL Report Builder allows you to directly query your data warehouse, view the results, and quickly transform them into a chart. The best part about using SQL to build reports is that you don’t need to wait on update cycles to iterate on columns you create.

Remember, __you need Admin permissions to access the SQL Report Builder!__
