Here are the resources we recommend using to get started if you want to reproduce an outside report - either from a SQL query, an Excel spreadsheet, or another document - in Magento BI:

* [Translating SQL queries to Magento BI reports](https://docs.magento.com/mbi/data-analyst/dev-reports/sql-queries-reports.html)

Additionally, if you're an Admin user, you can use the [SQL Report Builder](https://docs.magento.com/mbi/data-analyst/dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.html) to run your query if you donâ€™t want to use the Visual Report Builder.

Keep in mind that the SQL Report Builder may either be based on PostgreSQL or Redshift, so you may have to make some changes to your query syntax. If you are unsure which syntax to use for your account, [contact support](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251).
