This article explains how to log into your Fastly account provided with Adobe Commerce on our cloud infrastructure. Adobe Commerce for cloud does not require a dedicated Fastly account or account owner. You can configure and manage Fastly services from the Commerce Admin with the unique Fastly credentials (API token and service ID) provided with each Staging and Production environment. These credentials are also needed to submit Fastly API requests.

## How to view your Fastly credentials

Please refer to the [Get Fastly Credentials](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html#cloud-fastly-creds) section in our developer documentation.

## How to test the Fastly Credentials

Please refer to the [Test the Fastly Credentials](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/cdn/configure-fastly.html#test-the-fastly-credentials) section in our developer documentation.
