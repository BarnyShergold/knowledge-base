There are multiple ways where a merchant (or anyone interested in the site’s health) can identify site-downs, also known as site outages. A site-down is the time period when the merchant’s site cannot adequately respond to the customer’s requests. The definition of outages and their effects on sites is broad and the authors of this article will not attempt to make a thorough analysis on all possible outage cases or their cause.

The attached article attempts to describe:

* identify whether the issue is truly an outage, a small-scale outage or just a temporary impediment.
