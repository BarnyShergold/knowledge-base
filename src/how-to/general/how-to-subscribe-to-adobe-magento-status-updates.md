1. You see the subscriptions select products window. It may differ from the following screen shot as some subscriptions may be preselected based on your profile or because you have already set up some subscriptions. Click on **Adobe Magento** under Experience Cloud. If you want to receive notifications for all Adobe Magento services check the Adobe Magento checkbox. This will automatically select all Adobe Magento services which you can see when the Adobe Magento section expands (see screen shot).

    Alternatively, to select one Adobe Magento service, uncheck the other Adobe Magento services’ check boxes. So, for example if you only want to receive notifications for Order Management (MOM) uncheck the other services, so that only the Adobe Magento checkbox and the Order Management (MOM) checkbox are checked (see screen shot).

1. You see the subscriptions select regions and events window. If you want to receive notifications for the same regions and event types for all products check the **Select Regions and Event types for all Products** checkbox (seen screen shot).

   Alternately, if you have subscribed to several products (not just Adobe Magento) and want each product to have notifications for different regions and event types, check the **Customize Regions and event types by Products** checkbox (see screen shot).
