## What do I do if I come across a false positive in the scan report?

We recommend to our merchants to investigate all failed scans and take appropriate steps to resolve such issues. After investigation, if merchants come across a scan result that appears to be a false positive, we request the merchant to notify Adobe to take appropriate action.

To submit a false positive report, enter a ticket with Magento merchant support so that we can evaluate the false positive, make necessary changes, and/or provide recommendations to avoid seeing such notifications in the future. Merchants can also report a false positive by emailing us at <u>[securityscan@magento.com](mailto:securityscan@magento.com)</u>.
