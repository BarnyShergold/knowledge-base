Adobe Commerce continues to improve Accessibility and will be updating our Accessibility plans for 2022 soon.

The Adobe Commerce Luma theme is highly customizable as is the Commerce Admin.
Our customers can extend the Luma theme and create their own accessibility modules, and/or visit our Commerce Marketplace to vet an extension to meet your accessibility requirements. Here is a search string that displays the current available themes on Commerce Marketplace https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=Accessibility%20Theme.

Most of our customers are following the [W3C Accessibility documentations and Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/).

If you are using industry standard test tools, you can easily vet extensions or hire an accessibility developer to extend your Commerce Luma theme.
We cannot offer recommendations here, however many of our merchants have successfully used extensions and/or hired a development team to meet their accessibility requirements.

There are also many Adobe Commerce (Magento) certified development teams that specialize in accessibility and their requirements, test tools and development.
