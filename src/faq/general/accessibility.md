* We continue to work our Accessibility and will announce our Accessibility improvements for FY2022 soon.
* The Magento Luma theme is highly customizable as is the Magento Admin
* Our customers can extend the LUMA theme and create their own Accessibility Modules, and/or visit our Magneto Marketplace to vet an extension to meet your Accessibility requirements.”


* Shopping experience (e.g. LUMA theme) – Magento offers an out of the box theme as a way to get started, but virtually all (if not all) of our customers build their own website UI from scratch or heavily modify the base theme. This is also the case with our new PWA-bases storefront in Venia.
* The Magento admin itself can be customized, so we do not control all aspects of what is presented therein.  
* Both the shopper experience and admin can be extended by 3rd party extensions from the Magento marketplace or 3rd party marketplace
