Changes made in the `.magento.env.yaml` file do not affect the `app/etc/env.php` generated.

Steps to reproduce

Change any value in `.magento.env.yaml` and push to the server, where it should define the configuration (and deployment settings) for the currently checked-out environment. For steps, refer to Magento DevDocs [Environment Variables > Deploy Variables](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/env/variables-deploy.html) .

## [None](#cause) Cause

The issue could be caused by the incorrect value of the `opcache.enable_cli` parameter in the `php.ini` file.

## [None](#solution) Solution

1. Check that the system is configured according to [Magento Performance Best Practices > Software recommendations](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/performance-best-practices/software.html) .    
1. Check if `opcache.enable_cli` directive in `php.ini` is set to `0` by executing: `php -i | grep opcache.enable_cli`     
1. If the output looks like `opcache.enable_cli=1` , edit the `php.ini` file in the project root directory and change `opcache.enable_cli=1` to `opcache.enable_cli=0`     
1. Redeploy the project.
