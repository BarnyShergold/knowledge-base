This article describes a known Magento 2.3.5 issue, where the notification a merchant gets after a bulk action in Admin, contains a wrong number of affected items.

## Affected products and versions

* Magento Commerce Cloud 2.3.5
* Magento Commerce 2.3.5

## Issue

The system message displayed by Magento after a bulk action (for example, a mass product update or import/export) displays a count of 0 instead of an accurate count of the products affected by the bulk action.

## Fix

A fix will be available in Magento 2.3.6, which is scheduled for release in Q4 2020.
