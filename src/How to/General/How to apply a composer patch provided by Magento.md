This article instructs how to apply a composer patch for Magento Commerce, Magento Commerce Cloud, and Magento Open Source.

We strongly recommend applying and testing the patch on the Staging/Integration environment, before applying it Production. We also recommend you have a recent backup before any manipulations.

### How to apply a composer patch for Magento Commerce Cloud

1. If you do not have a directory named m2-hotfixes in the project root, please create one.

1. Copy the %patch\_name%.composer.patch file(s) to the m2-hotfixes directory.

1. 
Add, commit, and push your code changes:

git add -A 
git commit -m "Apply %patch\_name%.composer.patch patch"
git push origin

For additional information about applying patches to Cloud projects, see [Apply patches](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/project-patch.html) in Magento Developer Documentation.

### How to apply a composer patch for Magento CommerceÂ and Open Source

1. Upload the patch to your Magento root directory.

1. Run the following SSH command:
patch -p1 < %patch\_name%.composer.patch
(If the above command does not work, try using -p2 instead of -p1)

1. For the changes to be reflected, refresh the cache in the Admin under **System** > **Cache Management**.
