<p>For your Magento Commerce Cloud project, you may change the New Relic account owner on the New Relic UI page. For detailed steps, see <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/change-account-owner">Change the account Owner</a> (New Relic documentation).</p>
<p>If the user (that you want to assign the owner role to) is not listed on your account yet, you will need to add the user to the account. See <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/add-update-users">Add and update users</a> article, in particular the <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/roles-permissions/add-update-users#adding_users">Add a new user</a> section (New Relic documentation).</p>
<p>If someone needs to be added as a user but no existing Owner or Admin on the account can help them, any Magento user who has access to the New Relic's <a href="https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/1311131/users">Magento Partnership Owner Account</a> is able to view all Customer accounts and add users on the Customer's behalf.</p>
