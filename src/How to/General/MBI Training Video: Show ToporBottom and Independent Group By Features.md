You can do more in the Visual Report Builder than create analyses that trend over time. For example, you can build a report to show how valuable your acquisition and marketing channels are, but you can also build a report that shows only the top five performers. Additionally, you can also use independent Group Bys to compare two different metric values.

In this video, you'll learn:

* How to sort and order data using the Top/Bottom feature
* How to compare values using independent Group Bys
