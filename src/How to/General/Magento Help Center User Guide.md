<h2>WHAT IS MAGENTO HELP CENTER?</h2>
<p>Welcome to Magento Help Center! We are here to help solve your Magento issues quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Magento Help Center is the <a href="#kb">Knowledge Base</a> and the <a href="#support-tickets">Ticketing System</a>. This document shows how to use both of them.</p>
<h2>KNOWLEDGE BASE</h2>
<p>When you access the Help Center, you first get to the Magento Knowledge Base.</p>
<h3>What is Knowledge Base?</h3>
<p>The Magento Support Knowledge Base is a collection of articles based on the support tickets that Magento Customers or Partners submit.</p>
<p>Every Knowledge Base article covers a real-life issue or question and may be viewed as a reply to a submitted support ticket helping others to solve a similar problem.</p>
<h3>Knowledge Base does not replace DevDocs or User Guide</h3>
<p>The information in the Knowledge Base is designed as complementary to <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/">DevDocs</a>, the <a href="http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/getting-started.html">User Guide</a>, and <a href="https://magento.com/resources/technical">other Magento publications</a>, and only covers troubleshooting, best practices, hosts announcements, answers FAQ's, or highlights specific scenarios that have not been mentioned (for any reason) in the official documentation.</p>
<h3>Search for articles</h3>
<p>You don't need to be logged in to the Magento Help Center to search for articles in the Magento Knowledge Base.</p>
<p>To search for articles, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Knowledge Base landing page at <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us">https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us</a>.</li>
<li>In the Search field, start entering the keywords that an article should have.<br/>For example, <em>Redis</em>, <em>error</em>, <em>configuration management</em>, etc.<br/><br/><img alt="Search_Field_New_Inset_Image_1.jpg" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360064079291/Search_Field_New_Inset_Image_1.jpg"/>
</li>
<li>The top article suggestions are displayed below the Search field.</li>
<li>Select an article from the list and click it.<br/><br/><img alt="Select_An_Article_Image_1.jpg" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360064079431/Select_An_Article_Image_1.jpg"/>
</li>
<li>If you want the results of your search to be displayed on a new page:
<ul>
<li>Do not select an article from the suggestion list</li>
<li>After typing your search query, press Enter on your keyboard</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Search_Results_Image.png" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360063930192/Search_Results_Image.png"/></p>
<p>The search is not limited to the article title but also includes the article text; the most relevant matches are displayed first.</p>
<p>You can also select the article Tags on the bottom-left of the Search results page to select articles with those specific word tags that you are searching for.</p>
<p>You can search for articles using the Search field on any page of the Knowledge Base.</p>

<ul>
<li>
Announcements: articles with timely news and helpful information.</li>
<li>
Best Practices: articles with recommended techniques and procedures that are prescribed as most effective.</li>
<li>
Troubleshooting: articles that show how to solve a particular issue.<br/>For example, if you cannot perform an operation because of an error message, this is where you might find the solution.</li>
<li>
How To: articles with detailed steps on how to perform a particular operation.</li>
<li>
FAQ: answers to the most common, frequently asked questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>To find articles through navigating the categories, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Knowledge Base landing page at <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us">https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us</a>.</li>

<p>See <a href="#ticket-fields-explained">Ticket fields explained</a> below for more detailed information.</p>
<h3>"Submit a ticket" link not displayed on Magento Help Center start page</h3>
<h4>Issue</h4>
<p>You access the Magento Help Center and want to submit a support request, but the Submit a ticket link is not displayed on the Help Center start page.</p>
<h4>Cause</h4>
<p>One of the following might be the cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have not logged in to the Help Center.</li>
<li>If using shared access, you have not performed steps required to ensure that Magento Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com.</li>
<li>Your account is not entitled for Magento Support (for example, you are not a paying Commerce customer or you are an Open Source customer).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p><a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019086851">Log in to Help Center</a>.</p>
<p>The Submit a ticket link will only be displayed for customers with an email linked to a valid support agreement.</p>
<h4>Using shared access account</h4>
<p>To be able to use shared access account to submit support tickets, you need to perform the following (this needs to be done only once):</p>
<ol>
<li>After receiving <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052444712#who-can-provide-shared-access">shared access</a>, log in to your <a href="https://account.magento.com/">Magento account on the magento.com website</a>.</li>
<li>In the Switch Accounts drop-down field in top-right corner, select the shared access account.</li>
<li>Click on the Support tab in the left panel. Doing this will ensure that the Magento Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com to Magento Help Center.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Still don't see the Submit a ticket link</h4>
<p>If you don’t have Shared Accounts under the Switch Accounts drop-down list, but you are working for a client who has a Magento license, please ask them to grant you Shared Access. For more details review <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020694351">Provide shared access to Magento Account</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a Magento license owner, please verify that you don’t have an invoice with Pending Payment status. Support entitlements are automatically granted or revoked according to invoice payment status.</p>
<p>How To Check Your Payment Status:</p>
<ol>
<li>Login to <a href="http://support.magento.com/">magento.com</a>.</li>
<li>Click on Billing History on the left.</li>
<li>If you do have an invoice with Pending Payment status, please contact your Customer Success Manager to have the payment issue resolved.</li>
</ol>
<p>We provide support only to Magento license owners and accounts which have Shared Access to an account with a Magento license. If you need support for the Magento Open Source edition, please utilize these self-help technical resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.magento.com/">Magento Help Center</a></li>
<li><a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/">Magento Developer Docs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://magento.com/resources/technical">Magento Tech Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="https://community.magento.com/?_ga=2.99592990.1084044056.1559046120-720752292.1551793747">Magento Forums</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are having issues logging in to your account or believe Shared Access was set up correctly, but you still cannot see Submit a ticket button, please email <a href="mailto:helpcenterloginissues@magento.com">helpcenterloginissues@magento.com<sup><img alt="" src="https://jira.corp.magento.com/images/icons/mail_small.gif"/></sup></a>, and we will gladly review your account settings and support entitlements.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<em>"Please verify your email address"</em> error on the Magento account page</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>You won't be able to submit a support ticket if you receive the <em>Please verify your email address</em> error similar to the one below on the <a href="https://account.magento.com/">Magento account page</a>.<br/><br/><img alt="Verify_Email_Address_Error.png" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360063930612/Verify_Email_Address_Error.png"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The solution is to validate your email address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Validate Email button below the Email field on the <a href="https://account.magento.com/customer/account/edit/">Edit Account Information</a> page similar to the one below. <img alt="Validate_Email_Solution.png" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360063931752/Validate_Email_Solution.png"/>
</li>
<li>Clicking the Validate Email button will send an email to the email address registered for this Magento account with a link to validate the email address.</li>
<li>Click on the email validation link to validate your email and resolve this issue.</li>
<li>If you do not receive an email with an email validation link, please email <a href="mailto:helpcenterloginissues@magento.com">helpcenterloginissues@magento.com<sup><img alt="" src="https://jira.corp.magento.com/images/icons/mail_small.gif"/></sup></a> and indicate that you cannot validate your email address.
</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ticket submission form: merchant is not displayed in Organization drop-down</h3>

<p>Actual result:</p>
<p>The merchant corresponding to the used shared account is not available in the Organization options. </p>
<h4>Solution</h4>

<li>In the Switch Accounts drop-down field in top-right corner, select the shared access account.</li>

</ol>
<p> </p>

<h3>Ticket status: How your tickets are processed</h3>

<h4>2. Awaiting your reply</h4>
<p>Magento Support is expecting information from you.</p>
<p>In your reply, you may specify additional technical details of your issue, provide escalation details, or state if the solution, offered by Magento Support, has proved helpful for your issue.<br/>Make sure you provide your replies as soon as you can since Magento Support cannot proceed with processing your ticket while it is in the Awaiting your reply status.</p>

<h4>3. Solved</h4>
<p>Magento Support has provided a solution for your issue, and you have agreed it has been helpful.<br/><br/>It is you who marks the ticket as Solved. If the fixed issue occurs again, you may reopen the ticket, setting its status to back to Open.</p>
<h3>Conversation in your ticket</h3>
<p>Conversation in your ticket unites all comments written by you or the Magento Support Team. Comments are displayed from latest (on top) to earliest (bottom).</p>

</ol>
<h3>Resolve your ticket</h3>

<h2>SHARED ACCESS: GRANT PRIVILEGES FOR OTHER USERS TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>You may grant limited access to your account for other Magento account holders. In particular, using the shared access functionality, you may provide privileges for trusted employees and service providers to use your Help Center account so that they could work with your support tickets.</p>
<p>You can provide and manage shared access using your Magento Account page at <a href="https://account.magento.com/">https://account.magento.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Who can provide shared access</h3>
<p>Only the Account Owner (Primary Account Holder) with the according privileges can provide shared access for other users.</p>
<p>Managing users and their access is the customer's responsibility, especially in the shared access perspective. Thus, the Magento Support Team cannot provide shared access to a Magento account on behalf of a Customer. Customers are encouraged to add users with shared access themselves, using the <a href="https://account.magento.com/">Magento Account page</a>.</p>
<p>Users who have been provided with shared access cannot transfer or grant such access to other users.</p>
<h3>Get to know Account Owner (Cloud)</h3>
<p>To find out who is the Owner of your Magento Commerce (Cloud) Account, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access your Magento Commerce (Cloud) <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/project/projects.html">Project Web Interface</a>.</li>
<li>Click the gear icon (Configure Project) next to your Project Name (upper-left corner).</li>
<li>Go to the Users tab.</li>
