To identify the large tables, connect to the database as described in theÂ [Connect to the database](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/project-conf-files_services-mysql.html#connect-to-the-database) article, and run the following command, where project\_id is your Cloud project ID:

SELECT TABLE\_NAME AS `Table`,
 ROUND((DATA\_LENGTH + INDEX\_LENGTH) / 1024 / 1024) AS `Size (MB)`
FROM information\_schema.TABLES
WHERE TABLE\_SCHEMA = "%project\_id%"
ORDER BY (DATA\_LENGTH + INDEX\_LENGTH) DESC;

This would display the complete list of tables and their size. You can go through the list and identify which tables require attention because of the big size.
