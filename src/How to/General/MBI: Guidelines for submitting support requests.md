Magento BI is designed to be easy to use and to give you control over your data. If you can’t figure out how to troubleshoot a problem or complete a task in Magento BI, [submit a support ticket](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251).

Below is a list of Magento BI topics or issues users often have questions on. Links to articles that may help complete the task or troubleshoot the issue are provided. Even if the articles don’t provide the solution, they describe the information to include when submitting a ticket.  

There are some things our support team won't do. Check our [MBI Service Policies](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016730811) for the complete rundown.
