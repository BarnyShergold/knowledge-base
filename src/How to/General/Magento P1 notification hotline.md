## P1 incident definition

As defined in [Magento Support Services Terms and Conditions](https://magento.com/sites/default/files/magento-support-services-terms-and-conditions.pdf): "A P1 incident is a catastrophic production incident within the Service that severely impacts the Customer's Site, causing the site to cease from operating or accepting orders, or because of which Customer's Site is completely down or not functioning, or that results in a loss of production data and no workaround exists. P1 Incidents must be reported on Magento's toll-free P1 telephone number in order to expedite resolution. Magento will use continuous efforts, with appropriate escalation to senior management, to provide a resolution for a P1 Incident as soon as is commercially reasonable."
