To add or update prices in Shared Catalogs with API, we recommend using the `` TierPriceStorageInterface `` service, described in the [Manage tier prices](http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/rest/modules/catalog-pricing.html#manage-tier-prices)&nbsp;DevDocs REST API Reference. For Shared Catalog prices, we use Tier Price and Customer Group.
