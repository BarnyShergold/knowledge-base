<h2 id="follow-organization-tickets">Follow organization tickets</h2>

To follow or unfollow tickets for an organization, follow these steps:

1. Go to My tickets > Organization tickets tab.
1. Select an organization in the menu and click Follow or Unfollow.

<h2 id="ticket-status">Ticket status: how your tickets are processed</h2>

Your ticket may have either of these three statuses.

### 1. Open

Your ticket is not solved and is being processed by the Magento Support Team.

When you have provided all the info that is expected from you at a particular step in the conversation, and the next step needs to be taken by Magento Support — your ticket has the Open status.

### 1. Awaiting your reply

Magento Support is expecting info from you.

In your reply, you may specify additional technical details of your issue, provide escalation details, or state if the solution, offered by Magento Support, has proved helpful for your issue.   
Make sure you provide your replies soon since Magento Support cannot proceed with processing your ticket while it is in the Awaiting your reply status.

Reference to the [Magento Support ticket lifecycle policy update](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044226072) article for details about timing and notification policy. 

### 1. Solved

Magento Support has provided a solution for your issue, and you have agreed it has been helpful.

It is you who marks the ticket as Solved. If the fixed issue occurs again, you may reopen the ticket, setting its status to back to Open.

<h2 id="conversation-in-your-ticket">Conversation in your ticket</h2>

Conversation in your ticket unites all comments written by you or the Magento Support Team. Comments are displayed from latest (top) to earliest (bottom).

To add a comment to the conversation, follow these steps:

1. Scroll to the bottom of your ticket.
1. Click the Add to conversation field to start writing.

1. To add a person to your comment, specify the email in the CC field of the comment field.

1. Once you are through with your comment, click Submit.
