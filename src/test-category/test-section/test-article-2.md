Intro paragraph or two paragraphs: a brief overview of the area to which all the questions and answers belong, and why are these questions important; 120-170 words. Important for SEO purposes. Don't use bulleted lists; write in plain sentences. Don't use any headings, this should be a paragraph of text.

<h2 id="FAQ,singlequestion(KBarticletemplate)-&lt;Question>">&lt;Question 1></h2>

The question should be in the heading.

<h2 id="FAQ,singlequestion(KBarticletemplate)-&lt;Answer>">&lt;Answer 1></h2>

An answer, followed by any related information:

* additional remarks
* versions 
* technologies and tools
* screenshots
* links to related documentation

Do not document steps or workflows!

For example, an FAQ article should not start with _"How do I ...?"_ and then give steps. _"How do I ...?"_ is a How to article with its own structure.

The answer section should not have any heading or title.

<h2 id="FAQ,singlequestion(KBarticletemplate)-&lt;Question>">&lt;Question N></h2>

<h2 id="FAQ,singlequestion(KBarticletemplate)-&lt;Answer>">&lt;Answer N></h2>
