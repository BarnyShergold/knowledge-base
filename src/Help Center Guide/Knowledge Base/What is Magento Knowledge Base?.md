 What is Knowledge Base?
-----------------------

 The Magento Support Knowledge Base is a collection of articles based on the support tickets that Magento customers or partners submit.

 Every Knowledge Base article covers a real-life issue or question and may be viewed as a reply to a submitted support ticket helping others to solve a similar problem.

 Does Knowledge Base replace DevDocs or User Guide?
--------------------------------------------------

 No.

 The information in the Knowledge Base is designed as complementary to [DevDocs](http://devdocs.magento.com/), the [User Guide](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/getting-started.html), and [other Magento publications](https://magento.com/resources/technical), and only covers troubleshooting, answers FAQ's or highlights specific scenarios that have not been mentioned (for any reason) in the official documentation.
