<h2>Why do I need to know Account Owner?</h2>
<p>If you don't own the Magento Commerce Cloud license and want to work with support tickets for a Cloud project, you need to ask the Magento Account Owner to provide you with shared access. For this, you first have to identify the Account Owner.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you are a system integrator or a technical partner who develops a Magento Commerce Cloud project for your customer. The license for the Magento Cloud project (and the Magento Account) belongs to your customer, so only your customer may submit and manage the support tickets for the project, not you. To be able to submit support tickets and work with them, you need to ask for a shared access, and only the person who holds the Magento Account may provide shared access for you.</p>
<h2>Find Account Owner</h2>
<p>To find out who is the Owner of a Magento Commerce Cloud project, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access the Magento Commerce Cloud <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/cloud/project/projects.html">Project Web Interface</a>.</li>
<li>Click the gear icon (Configure Project) next to the Project Name (upper-left corner).</li>
<li>Go to the Users tab.</li>
<li>Find the user who is mentioned as the Account owner.</li>
</ol>

<h2>I still cannot find Account Owner</h2>
<p>If, for any reason, the steps above are not applicable to you, and you are still not sure who your Account Owner is, contact your Magento Customer Success Manager (CSM).</p>
