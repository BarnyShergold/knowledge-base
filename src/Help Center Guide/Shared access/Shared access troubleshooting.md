## I use shared access but still see my tickets instead of the shared ones

<span class="wysiwyg-color-red">__Problem:__</span> I'm accessing Help Center using shared access but still see only the tickets belonging to my own account (organization). The Magento Account page shows I'm using the account of the organization that has provided shared access for me, but the organization tickets are still not showing.
