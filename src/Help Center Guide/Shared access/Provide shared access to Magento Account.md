<p>See the <a href="http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/magento/magento-account-share.html">Sharing Your Account</a> section of Magento User Guide for detailed steps on setting up a shared account.</p>
<p>After providing shared access for a new user, the shared access configuration information is available in Shared Access &gt; Manage PermissionsÂ tab of your Magento.com Account page.<br/> <img alt="magento-account-shared-manage-permissions.png" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360016696931/magento-account-shared-manage-permissions.png"/></p>
<p>After receiving shared access, the user needs to take these steps (once) to establish access to the Magento Help Center:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to their Magento account.</li>
<li>In the Switch Accounts drop-down field in top-right corner, select the shared access account.</li>
<li>Click on the Support tab in the left panel. Doing this will ensure that the Magento Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com to Magento Help Center</li>
</ol>
