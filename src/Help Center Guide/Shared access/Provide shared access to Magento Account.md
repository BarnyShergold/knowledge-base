See the [Sharing Your Account](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/magento/magento-account-share.html) section of Magento User Guide for detailed steps on setting up a shared account.

After providing shared access for a new user, the shared access configuration information is available in **Shared Access** > **Manage Permissions**Â tab of your Magento.com Account page.

After receiving shared access, the user needs to take these steps (once) to establish access to the Magento Help Center:

1. Log in to their Magento account.

1. In the **Switch Accounts** drop-down field in top-right corner, select the shared access account.

1. Click on the **Support** tab in the left panel. Doing this will ensure that the Magento Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com to Magento Help Center
