Is a certain feature behaving unexpectedly? Or perhaps you noticed a broken link somewhere? Help us resolve those defects by pointing them out! [Reach out to us](https://support.rjmetrics.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and include the following:

*   Instructions to recreate the defect
*   Screenshots (or screencasts!) showing the unexpected behavior
    
    *   Include any errors displayed in your browser's console as documented below.
    
    
    
*   If you found a broken link, include how you got to the page its on. Screenshots of where it is on the page are also helpful.

## Document any errors and reach out to support.

__Note that this step isn’t always required, but proactively completing it could reduce the time spent going back-and-forth on a support request.__

If you’re still unable to access your account, we recommend checking for errors and submitting a ticket to our support team. How can you do this? By opening your browser’s developer tools and taking a screenshot of any errors displayed in the the console, or site log window. In the GIF below, I’m opening the developer tools for Google Chrome:

<a data-lightbox="image-1" data-title="Opening Chrome's developer tools." href="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360014036772/Opening_Chrome_dev_tools.gif"> 

<img alt="Opening Chrome's developer tools." src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360014036772/Opening_Chrome_dev_tools.gif" style="max-width:500px"/>

 </a>  
 _Click for a closer look!_

In the above example, we used the most common method (__right click &gt; Inspect__) to open the console. If your browser doesn’t have this method or you need help, use the documentation links below for the web browser you’re using:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><a href="http://www.technipages.com/mac-os-x-enable-web-inspector-in-safari">Safari</a></td>
<td><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Opening_the_Web_Console">Firefox</a></td>
<td><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en">Chrome</a></td>
<td><a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/documentation/">Opera</a></td>
<td><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg589512(v=vs.85).aspx#OpeningTools">Internet Explorer</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In some browsers, opening the developer tools might not automatically display the console - the site’s code may display first. If this happens to you, click the Console option in the developer window and take screenshots of any errors displayed there.

[Submit a ticket to our Support team](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251) with the __error screenshots__.
