If the __Submit a ticket__ link is not displayed on the Help Center start page, you might be not logged in. Make sure you are logged in.

## Issue

You access the Magento Help Center and want to submit a support request, but the __Submit a ticket__ link is not displayed on the Help Center start page. Instead, the two links are displayed:

*   Magento.com
*   Log In

## Cause

You have not logged in to the Help Center. Only authenticated users can submit support tickets.

## Solution

[Log in to Help Center](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019086851).

The “Submit a ticket” link will only be displayed for customers with an email linked to a valid support agreement. If you believe that you are entitled to support and the “Submit a ticket” link is not available or you are having issues logging in to your account, please email&nbsp;<span class="nobr"><a class="external-link" href="mailto:helpcenterloginissues@magento.com" rel="nofollow" title="Follow link">helpcenterloginissues@magento.com<sup>

<img align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0" class="rendericon" height="12" src="https://jira.corp.magento.com/images/icons/mail_small.gif" width="13"/>

</sup></a></span>&nbsp;and we will gladly review your account settings and support entitlements.

If you do not have a support agreement and need support of Magento Open Source edition, please utilize these resources to find answers to your technical questions:
