This article discusses the most common reasons for the **Submit a ticket** link not being displayed on the Magento Help Center start page and provides steps to fix them.

## Issue

You access the Magento Help Center and want to submit a support request, but the **Submit a ticket** link is not displayed on the Help Center start page.

## Cause

One of the following might be the cause:

* You have not logged in to the Help Center.

* If using shared access, you have not performed steps required to ensure that Magento Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com.

* Your account is not entitled for Magento Support (for example, you are not a paying Commerce customer or you are an Open Source customer).

## Solution

[Log in to Help Center](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019086851).

The **Submit a ticket** link will only be displayed for customers with an email linked to a valid support agreement.

### Using shared access account

To be able to use shared access account to submit support tickets, you need to perform the following (needs to be done only once):

1. After receiving shared access, log in to your [Magento account on the magento.com website](https://account.magento.com/).

1. In the **Switch Accounts** drop-down field in top-right corner, select the shared access account.

1. Click on the **Support** tab in the left panel. Doing this will ensure that the Magento Help Center is configured properly via the SSO call from Magento.com to Magento Help Center.

## Still don't see the link

If you believe that you are entitled to support and the “Submit a ticket” link is not available or you are having issues logging in to your account, please email [helpcenterloginissues@magento.com![](https://jira.corp.magento.com/images/icons/mail_small.gif)](mailto:helpcenterloginissues@magento.com "Follow link") and we will gladly review your account settings and support entitlements.
