<p>Your tickets are those that you:</p>
<ul>
<li>have submitted personally</li>
<li>have been added to — as a watcher through a CC (carbon copy)</li>
</ul>
<h2>View your tickets</h2>
<p>To list all your tickets, click your profile menu (upper-right corner) on the Help Center start page and select My tickets.</p>

<p>To switch between your tickets and the tickets you have been CC'd on, click the corresponding tab:</p>
<ul>
<li>My tickets</li>
<li>Tickets I'm CC'd on</li>
<li>
Organization tickets (available if your account is associated with several organizations)</li>
</ul>

<p>To sort tickets, click Created or Last Activity column headers.</p>
<h2>Search for tickets</h2>

<h2>Follow organization tickets</h2>
<p>You may follow the support tickets submitted by the members of your organization.</p>
<p>When you follow your organization tickets, you:</p>
<ul>
<li>may view tickets within the Organization tickets tab</li>
<li>receive email notifications when the new tickets are submitted, or the existing tickets are changed</li>
</ul>
<p>To follow or unfollow tickets for an organization, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to My tickets &gt; Organization tickets tab.</li>
<li>Select an organization in the menu and click Follow or Unfollow.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Ticket status: how your tickets are processed</h2>
<p>Your ticket may have either of these three statuses.</p>
<h3>1. Open</h3>
<p>Your ticket is not solved and is being processed by the Magento Support Team.</p>
<p>When you have provided all the info that is expected from you at a particular step in the conversation, and the next step needs to be taken by Magento Support — your ticket has the Open status.</p>
<h3>2. Awaiting your reply</h3>
<p>Magento Support is expecting info from you.</p>
<p>In your reply, you may specify additional technical details of your issue, provide escalation details, or state if the solution, offered by Magento Support, has proved helpful for your issue. <br/>Make sure you provide your replies soon since Magento Support cannot proceed with processing your ticket while it is in the Awaiting your reply status.</p>
<p>Reference to the <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044226072">Magento Support ticket lifecycle policy update</a> article for details about timing and notification policy. </p>
<h3>3. Solved</h3>
<p>Magento Support has provided a solution for your issue, and you have agreed it has been helpful.</p>
<p>It is you who marks the ticket as Solved. If the fixed issue occurs again, you may reopen the ticket, setting its status to back to Open.</p>
<h2>Conversation in your ticket</h2>
<p>Conversation in your ticket unites all comments written by you or the Magento Support Team. Comments are displayed from latest (top) to earliest (bottom).</p>
<p>To add a comment to the conversation, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of your ticket.</li>
<li>Click the Add to conversation field to start writing.<br/><br/><img alt="hc_add-to-conversation.png" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360016544612/hc_add-to-conversation.png"/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>To add a person to your comment, specify the email in the CC field of the comment field.<br/><br/><img alt="hc_conversation-write.png" src="https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360016596291/hc_conversation-write.png"/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Once you are through with your comment, click Submit.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Resolve your ticket</h2>
<p>To resolve your ticket, click Mark as solved at the bottom of your ticket.</p>
