<li>Magento CommerceÂ Cloud 2.X.X</li>
<li>Magento Open Source 2.X.X</li>

<h2>Issue</h2>
<p>The advanced search function is not returning the most relevant results first, like the quick search is doing. The issue does not depend on the selected search engine type.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the storefront, go to the quick search and search for "Fitted Jacket".</li>
<li>Notice "Orion Two-Tone Fitted Jacket" is the first result.</li>
<li>Go to advanced search and search for "Fitted Jacket" in the name field.</li>
</ol>
<p>Expected result:</p>
<p>The "Orion Two-Tone Fitted Jacket" is the first result when using Advanced search, as the most relevant result.</p>
<p>Actual result:</p>
<p>The "Orion Two-Tone Fitted Jacket" is not the first result, though it is the most relevant.</p>
