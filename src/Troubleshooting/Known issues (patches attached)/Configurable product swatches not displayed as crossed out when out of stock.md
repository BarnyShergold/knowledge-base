<p>This article provides a patch for the known Magento Commerce 2.2.2 issue related to the configurable product swatches being out of stock not displayed as crossed out on the storefront.</p>
<h2>Issue</h2>
<p>When you have a configurable product and for certain combination of options the related simple product is out of stock, the swatch is still available and can be selected on the storefront.</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Magento Admin, create a configurable product with options for two attributes: color(red, black) and size (S,M,L).</li>
<li>Set Quantity as "1" for each corresponding simple product.</li>
<li>On the storefront, add red,M product to cart and checkout.</li>
<li>In the Admin, process the order so that the item quantity is updated to "0".</li>
<li>Make sure backorders are not allowed.</li>
<li>On the storefront, navigate to the same product page and select the same options: red, M.</li>
</ol>
<p>Expected result:</p>
<p>The red, M swatch has a red slash and cannot be selected.</p>
<p>Actual result:<br/>The red, M swatch can be selected.</p>
