 Issue
-----

 An error occurs when entering the country and region during order placement in PayPal Express Checkout. The issue is reproducible for any country where the region field in the address section is a text field (as opposed to a drop-down menu). 

 Steps to reproduce:

 
 2. Enable PayPal Express Checkout.
 4. Add product to cart as a guest or when you are logged in.
 6. Go to checkout.
 8. Select your shipping address. For example, the *UK*. Then enter an input into the **State/Province** field. For example, *Nottinghamshire*.
 10. Click on the **Place Order** button to place order. You get a successful order page and email from Magento.
 
 Expected Result:  
 The order is placed successfully.  
   
 Actual Result:  
  
When the order button is clicked on an error displays:
