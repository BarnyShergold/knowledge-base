This article provides a patch for the known Magento Ð¡ommerce Cloud 2.2.3 issue related to having not selected records being deleted when a bulk deletion is performed in a grid in Magento Admin.

## Issue

In Magento Admin, if you select customer or client records to be deleted, filter the grid, and then select the Delete action, all records are deleted.

Steps to reproduce (with Products grid for an example):

1. Navigate to Catalog > Products in Magento Admin.
1. Select a product or multiple products.
1. Select Delete from the Actions drop-down menu.
