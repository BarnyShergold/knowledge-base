-----

 Steps to reproduce

 Import files and trigger a deployment.

"*SQLSTATE[HY000] [2006] MySQL server has gone away at/app/AAAAAAAAA/vendor/magento/zendframework1/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php:144"*

 Cause
-----

 The default\_socket\_timeout value is set too low. This is caused by the setting default\_socket\_timeout. If php doesn't receive anything from the MySQL database within this period, it assumes it is disconnected and throws the error. 

 Solution
--------

 
 2. Check the current timeout period for default\_socket\_timeout by running in the CLI:  
  php -i |grep default\_socket\_timeout 
 4. Depending on the timeout setting increase, the default\_socket\_timeout variable to the expected longest possible run time in the /etc/platform/<project\_name>/php.ini file. It is suggested that you set between 10-15 mins. 
 6. Commit it to GIT and redeploy.
