<p>At Magento BI, our goal is to provide stellar customer service, safeguard your data, and give you the know-how you need to make data-driven decisions.</p>
<h2>What <u>can</u> your Support team do?</h2>
<p>Our support team can help you with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolving product defects</li>
<li>Resolving performance issues</li>
<li>Resolving data discrepancies</li>
<li>Documentation questions and requests</li>
<li>Product/feature guidance</li>
<li>Creating advanced calculated columns</li>
<li>Conducting a new analysis</li>
<li>Migrating a database/assisting with structural changes</li>
</ul>
<h2>What <u>doesn't</u> your Support team do?</h2>
<p>Because we want to ensure that only the people you authorize can access your data, there are few tasks our Support team won't perform.</p>
<p>While we can't perform these actions on your behalf, we're more than willing to walk you through them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.magento.com/mbi/administrator/user-management/user-management.html">Creating and modifying user account information</a></li>
<li>Entering or modifying billing information</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.magento.com/mbi/data-user/dashboards/share-dashboard-with-users.html">Sharing dashboards with other users</a></li>
<li>Discussing, creating, or modifying data connections and server details</li>
<li>Performing Admin-level functions for Standard or Read-only users (e.g. <a href="https://docs.magento.com/mbi/data-user/reports/ess-manage-data-metrics.html">adding/editing metrics</a>)</li>
<li>Disclosing account details - for example, reports or billing information - on inbound phone calls. We'll follow-up with a registered email address.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the data security functions listed above, there are a few product-related requests our support team can't accommodate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Teaching SQL - Want to use the SQL Report Builder but you don't know SQL? No worries - we put together a <a href="https://docs.magento.com/mbi/data-analyst/dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.html">tutorial</a> to help you with the basics. For links to more in-depth walkthroughs and interactive practice materials you can check out the following articles:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016730371">PostgreSQL resources</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016730471">SQL tutorials and resources</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
SQL visualization problems <u>not</u> caused by product defects - If a chart winds up looking a little wonky and it isn't caused by a product defect, it's likely that the cause is the query itself. Take a look at our <a href="https://docs.magento.com/mbi/tutorials/create-visuals-from-sql.html">Creating visualizations from SQL queries tutorial</a> for guidance on how to structure your queries for visualization.</li>
<li>
Debugging SQL queries - From time to time, you may encounter non-EXPLAIN errors that keep your query from running. We recommend referring to the <a href="https://docs.magento.com/mbi/data-analyst/dev-reports/sql-rpt-bldr.html">MBI User Guide: Using the SQL Report Builder</a> and our SQL tutorial for help pinpointing where the query went wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What if my request falls under the second category?</h2>
<p>Don't worry. If you still have questions or think something might be a defect, we still want you to reach out to us. We'll work together to find a solution that works for everyone.</p>
<h2>How do I submit a ticket?</h2>
<p>You can <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000913794-Magento-Help-Center-User-Guide#submit-ticket">submit a ticket</a> to our Support team by clicking the Submit a ticket link at the top of the page. We recommend checking out our <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016730351">Ticket Guidelines</a> before you reach out to us to make sure all the necessary information is in your initial submission.</p>
