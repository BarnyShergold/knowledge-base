Is a certain feature behaving unexpectedly? Or perhaps you noticed a broken link somewhere? Help us resolve those defects by pointing them out! [Reach out to us](https://support.rjmetrics.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and include the following:

* Instructions to recreate the defect

* Screenshots (or screencasts!) showing the unexpected behavior

	
	* Include any errors displayed in your browser's console as documented below.

* If you found a broken link, include how you got to the page its on. Screenshots of where it is on the page are also helpful.

## Document any errors and reach out to support.

**Note that this step isn’t always required, but proactively completing it could reduce the time spent going back-and-forth on a support request.**

If you’re still unable to access your account, we recommend checking for errors and submitting a ticket to our support team. How can you do this? By opening your browser’s developer tools and taking a screenshot of any errors displayed in the console, or site log window. In the GIF below, I’m opening the developer tools for Google Chrome:

*Click for a closer look!*

In the above example, we used the most common method (**right click > Inspect**) to open the console. If your browser doesn’t have this method or you need help, use the documentation links below for the web browser you’re using:

[Safari](http://www.technipages.com/mac-os-x-enable-web-inspector-in-safari)
[Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Opening_the_Web_Console)
[Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en)
[Opera](http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/documentation/)
[Internet Explorer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg589512(v=vs.85).aspx#OpeningTools)

In some browsers, opening the developer tools might not automatically display the console - the site’s code may display first. If this happens to you, click the Console option in the developer window and take screenshots of any errors displayed there.

[Submit a ticket to our Support team](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251) with the **error screenshots**.
