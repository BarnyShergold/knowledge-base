This article provides solutions for errors you can experience when the Elasticsearch (ES) service is not running (usually as a result of crashing). Symptoms can include errors when running health checks using curl, reindexing using the command line, Exception and PHP errors, and errors on product pages. The table lists errors and links to resources to attempt to solve them. One symptom can have a range of different causes.

 Elasticsearch version compatibility with Magento
------------------------------------------------

 
 * Magento Commerce and Magento Commerce Cloud: 
	 + v2.2.3+ supports ES 5.x
	 + v2.2.8+ and v2.3.1+ support ES 6.x
	 + ES v2.x and v5.x are not recommended because of [End of Life](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol). However, if you have Magento v2.3.1 and want to use ES 2.x or ES 5.x, you must [Change the Elasticsearch php Client](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/elasticsearch/es-downgrade.html). 
 * Magento Open Source v2.3.0+ supports ES 5.x and 6.x (but 6.x is recommended).
