If the Magento backup functionality does not start or displays the following message, you need to enable the feature prior to backing up.

Backup functionality is currently disabled. Please use other means for backups.</code></pre>

Enter the following CLI command:

<pre><code class="language-bash">bin/magento config:set system/backup/functionality_enabled 1</code></pre>
