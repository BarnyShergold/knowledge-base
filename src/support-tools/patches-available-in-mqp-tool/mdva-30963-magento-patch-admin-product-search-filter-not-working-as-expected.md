The MDVA-30963 patch solves the issue where in Magento admin, the product search filter does not work as expected. Values that are overridden in a store view scope are also considered when filtering on **All store view** store view scope. This patch is available when the [Magento Quality Patch (MQP) tool](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/comp-mgr/patching.html#mqp) v.1.0.8 is installed. Please note that the issue is scheduled to be fixed in Magento version 2.4.2.

## Affected products and versions

* The patch was designed for Magento Commerce Cloud 2.4.0.
* The patch is also compatible with Magento Commerce and Magento Commerce Cloud 2.3.2 - 2.4.1.

>Note: the patch might become applicable to other versions with new MQP tool releases. To check if the patch is compatible with your Magento version, run `./vendor/bin/magento-patches status` .

## Issue

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Steps to reproduce:</span> 

1. Set **Stores > Configuration > Catalog > Catalog  > Price > Catalog Price Scope** = *Website* .
1. Create 2 websites having 2 different currencies (For example, the default website is an India Store \[Rupee â‚¹\] and the second one is an US Store \[Dollar $\]).
1. Set the following **Base Currency** , **Default Display Currency** , and **Allowed Currencies** :
    * **Default Config** = *US Dollar (Default)* 
    * **Main Website** = *Indian Rupee* 
    * **WebsiteUS** = **Use Default** = *US Dollar* 
1. Set **Stores > Currency Rates** = *1:1* .
1. Create a test simple product assigned to both Websites and has following prices:
    * **Default Price** = **US Website price** = *123 USD* 
    * **Main Website price** = *321 Rupee* 
1. Create a subAdmin user that has access only to the US Store.
1. Go to the US storefront, and put a product in the cart (Example: *123 USD price* ).
1. Login to the Admin with subAdmin just created (Example: *US Only admin* ).
1. Go to **Reports > Products in cart** .

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Expected results:</span> 

When filtering within the **All store view** store view scope, products filtering should get the value set in that particular scope.

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Actual results:</span> 

Values overridden in a store view scope are also considered when filtering on "All store view" store view scope.
