## Issue

Sitemaps generated by cron in Magento contain the wrong image URL path.

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Steps to reproduce</span> 

1. In Magento Admin, create a new website, store, or store view.
1. Add at least one product to each store, and add at least one image to each of the products.
1. Enable **Sitemap Generation By Schedule** in **Admin > Stores > Configuration > CATALOG > XML Sitemap > Generation Settings** .
1. Generate a sitemap for any of 2 stores manually in **Admin > Marketing > Site Map** using a sitemap name like " *sitemap.xml* ".
    * Rename the file to something like " *manual\_sitemap.xml* " or copy the file content to any text editor.
1. Generate the same sitemap by cron job `sitemap_generate` .
1. Compare the manually generated sitemap " *manual\_sitemap.xml* " and the sitemap generated by cron " *sitemap.xml* ".

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Expected result:</span> 

The cached sitemap image path URL is correct.

 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Actual result:</span> 

The sitemap generated by cron contains the wrong image path URL. If you try to open the image from " *sitemap.xml* ", it will show a default placeholder.Manually generated sitemap URLs are unaffected by this issue.
