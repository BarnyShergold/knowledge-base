Site-Wide Analysis Tool is a SaaS (software as a service) application that performs end-to-end 'point-in-time' Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure site analysis (within the SWAT environment, not on the customer's site). All tool-related customer site information is collected on predetermined schedules from every three hours to once a day. This means that SWAT is constantly analyzing customer site data for Findings.
