During the peak holiday sales season (approximately Mid-November through Mid-January), Magento recommends that Commerce Cloud Pro &amp; Starter customers prepare for increased traffic with planned server capacity increases.

Read on for information for both Cloud Pro and Cloud Starter Customers on planning for heavy holiday traffic.&nbsp;

## Commerce Cloud Pro

All Commerce Cloud Pro customers will have their cloud capacity automatically upsized to the next environment size, which will provide at least double the CPU and memory during the following date ranges:

*   November 15 – December 5
*   December 20 – January 5

There is no action required by you or your team to take advantage of this increased capability; and there is no impact to your licensed average capacity.

If your organization needs increased capacity outside of the dates listed above, please <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251-Submit-a-support-ticket" target="_self">file a Support Ticket</a> via our <a class="external-link" href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us" rel="nofollow" title="Follow link">Help Center</a> indicating the dates and anticipated capacity needs by November 8. (We do recommend that organizations consider their expected traffic during the period between December 5 and December 20.) Please note that requests for increased capacity outside of the date ranges listed above will be charged against your licensed overage capacity.

If you anticipate needing more than double your contracted capacity _within the date ranges listed above__,_ please <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251-Submit-a-support-ticket" target="_self">file a Support Ticket</a> at our <a class="external-link" href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us" rel="nofollow" title="Follow link">Help Center</a> and provide our team with information on your capacity needs by November 1. (Not sure if double is enough or if you need more? Please contact our Support team or your Customer Success Manager (CSM).

## Commerce Cloud Starter

Due to Starter’s shared infrastructure, programmatically adding capacity for Starter customers is not possible in the same manner as Commerce Pro (Learn more about the Starter architecture on our <a class="external-link" href="https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/cloud/basic-information/starter-architecture.html" rel="nofollow" title="Follow link">DevDocs</a>. )

As a result, Commerce Cloud Starter customers that anticipate a need for additional capacity during the holiday season should <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251-Submit-a-support-ticket" target="_self">file a Support Ticket</a> via our <a class="external-link" href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us" rel="nofollow" title="Follow link">Help Center</a> indicating the dates and expected capacity needs by November 8. Please note that increased capacity will require usage of your licensed overage capacity.

Not sure how much capacity is enough this holiday season? Please contact our Support team or your CSM with information about expected traffic and order volume spikes.
