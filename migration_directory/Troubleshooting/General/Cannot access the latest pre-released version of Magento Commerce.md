This article talks about how to solve the issues you might have when trying to access the latest pre-released version of Magento Commerce code, in the scope of the Pre-release Access program.

## Issue

This article covers the following issues with accessing the pre-released code:

*   Magento Commerce pre-released version is not available for download under __My Account__ &gt; __Downloads__&nbsp;on <a href="https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login" target="_self">account.magento.com</a>.
*   Failure to download the pre-released Magento Commerce version from <a href="https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login" target="_self">repo.magento.com</a> using composer.

## Cause

These are the most common causes of the issue:

*   You are looking for the pre-released code in the wrong location.
*   You are using the wrong MageID.
*   Your account is not a part of of the Pre-release Access program.

## Solution

### Pre-release code location

During the pre-release access period,&nbsp;release packages are only available via composer on <a href="https://repo.magento.com/" target="_self">repo.magento.com</a>. Release packages are not available on GitHub and Magento portal&nbsp;during this period, and we will publish them to these locations&nbsp;on the GA date.

### MageID you need to use

You must use the primary MageID associated with your Magento Commerce or Partner account. The Pre-release Access program is not linked to any contact having shared access. The early access can only be accessed via Composer or repo.magento.com by the MAGID associated with Magento Commerce license or Partner license.&nbsp;

#### How do I find out if my MageID is the primary one

__For merchants__

To find out if your MageID is primary, try the following:

1.   Log into <a href="https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login" target="_self">account.magento.com</a> and go to the __My Product and Services__ tab. Check if you see the&nbsp;Magento Commerce license information there:
    
    *   If you see the Magento Commerce license information, then your MageID is primary.
    *   If you do not see the&nbsp;Magento Commerce license information, then your MageID only has shared access. To find out who is the primary ID holder, go to&nbsp;the __Shared with me__ tab. Notice the SHARENAME specified there. Click __Switch Accounts__, and select the value you've noted in SHARENAME. On the welcome page you will see the email of the primary ID holder.
    
    
    
2.   If for any reason you cannot find this information on <a href="https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login" target="_self">account.magento.com</a>,&nbsp;please contact your&nbsp;Customer Success Manager (CSM).
3.   If none of the above works, please <a href="https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019088251-Submit-a-support-ticket" target="_self">contact support</a>.

__For partners__

To find out if your MageID is primary, try the follow:

1.   Log into <a href="https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login" target="_self">account.magento.com</a> and go to the __My Product and Services__ tab. In the Partners sub-section, check if you see the active Partner license information:  
    
    
    *   If you see the active &nbsp;Partner license information,&nbsp;then your MageID is primary.&nbsp;The Partner license is active, if the END DATE value is a date in future.&nbsp;
    *   If you do not see the active Partner license information, then your MageID only has shared access. To find out who is the primary ID holder, go to&nbsp;the __Shared with me__ tab. Notice the SHARENAME specified there. Click __Switch Accounts__, and select the value you've noted in SHARENAME. On the welcome page you will see the email of the primary ID holder.
