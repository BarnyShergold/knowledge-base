__Having connection issues?&nbsp;__Authorizing an integration grants Magento BI the required privileges to pull data from a third party service. Re-authorization is required when these privileges are revoked.

This could happen due to a number of reasons:

*   an issue with the third party service
*   authentication token expiration
*   a change made on your administrative account
*   or an internal issue within Magento BI

The status of all integrations is on the Integrations&nbsp;page (__Manage D____ata &gt; Integrations__):

![Integrations_page.png](https://support.magento.com/hc/article_attachments/360014035232/Integrations_page.png)

To re-authenticate, you&nbsp;may have to re-enter your account credentials. In some cases, you may be required to generate new API keys for the problem integration.&nbsp;Click the name of the problem integration to begin the reauthorization process.

If the problem persists after checking and/or re-entering your credentials, feel free to contact us.
