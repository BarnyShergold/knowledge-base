This article provides a fix for errors received during order placement when selecting a region in PayPal Express Checkout. The issue is caused by changes made in the Magento v2.3.4 release and is related to how PayPal Express Checkout address fields are parsed.

## Affected Versions and Products&nbsp;

*   Magento Commerce Cloud v2.3.4
*   Magento Commerce v2.3.4

## Issue

An error occurs when entering the country and region during order placement in PayPal Express Checkout. The issue is reproducible for any country where the region field in the address section is a text field (as opposed to a drop-down menu).&nbsp;

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Steps to Reproduce</span>:

1.   Enable PayPal Express Checkout.
2.   Add product to cart as a guest or when you are logged in.
3.   Go to checkout.
4.   Select your shipping address. For example, the _UK_. Then enter an input into the __State/Province__ field. For example, _Nottinghamshire_.
5.   Click on the __Place&nbsp;Order__ button to place order. You get a&nbsp;successful order page and email from Magento.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Expected Result:</span>  
 The order is placed successfully.  
   
 <span class="wysiwyg-underline">Actual Result:  
  
</span>When the order button is clicked on an error displays:

<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-clike">Error 500: NOTICE: PHP message: PHP Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to a member
  function getId() on null in httpdocs/vendor/magento/module-paypal/Model/Api/Nvp.php:1527</code></pre>
