<h2 id="what-is-kb">What is Knowledge Base?</h2>

The Magento Support Knowledge Base is a collection of articles based on the support tickets that Magento customers or partners submit.

Every Knowledge Base article covers a real-life issue or question and may be viewed as a reply to a submitted support ticket helping others to solve a similar problem.

<h2 id="kb-devdocs-user-guide">Does Knowledge Base replace DevDocs or User Guide?</h2>

No.

The information in the Knowledge Base is designed as complementary to [DevDocs](http://devdocs.magento.com/), the [User Guide](http://docs.magento.com/m2/ee/user_guide/getting-started.html), and [other Magento publications](https://magento.com/resources/technical), and only covers troubleshooting, answers FAQ's or highlights specific scenarios that have not been mentioned (for any reason)&nbsp;in the official documentation.
