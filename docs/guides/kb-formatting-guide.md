## Author in Markdown
Generally, we use [GitHub flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), but in some circumstances HTML is allowed or even required.

Following are the examples of the Markdown formatting that is most commonly used in our repo.

## Basic formatting

To format text as bold, inclose it in two asterisks:

`This will be **bold** text`

To format text as italics, use a single asterisk:

`This text will be *italics*`

## Headers

Use the following formatting for headers from H2 to H5. H1 is never used since article title in considered H1.

`## Header 2 `

`### Header 3 `

`#### Header 4`

`##### Header 5`

## Code inline and blocks

Use single backticks to enclose the code element you would like to highlight:

This \` inline code \` within a paragraph of text.

### Code blocks

To insert a code block without highlighting, enclose the code block in triple backticks.

\`\`\`

```markdown
```
code block here
```
```

\`\`\`

To add highlighting to the code block, specify the language after opening triple backticks:

\`\`\` sql

SELECT TABLE_NAME AS `Table`,
  ROUND((DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) / 1024 / 1024) AS `Size (MB)`
FROM information_schema.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = "%project_id%"
ORDER BY (DATA_LENGTH + INDEX_LENGTH) DESC;
\`\`\`

For the list of supported languages check https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml.

If the highlighting doesn't work for a certain language in markdown, to make it at least highlighted when published to https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/, use the following HTML:

```html
<pre><code class="language-%language-code%"
your code here
</pre></code>
```

Where %language-code% are the codes defined by [Prism.js supported languages](https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages).

## Lists

Always separate lists from the rest of content by blank lines.

Use the following formatting for ordered lists:

```
1. First numbered list item.
1. Second numbered list item.
...
1. Last numbered list item.
```

To create unordered bulleted list, begin a line with *, or +, or -. But select one method and use it consistently throughout the article.

Example:

```
* Unordered list item.
* Unordered list item.
...
* Last unordered list item.
```
To add content between list items, add 4 spaces in the begining of the line:

```
* List item.
* List item.
    Here's some content between list items.
* Here we continue the list
```

You can embed lists this way as well.

## Links

External links are straight-forward and can be rendered as a linked caption or a pure URL.
```markdown
[Adobe](https://www.adobe.com)
```

### Links to images

To insert an image, place the image to assets sub-folder in the same section folder as the article, and use the following syntax to insert the image to your article:

```markdown
![alt text](assets/image.png)
```

### Links to attached files
You can upload .pdf and .zip files and add links to them in article, so that users can download the files.

To do so, place the files in the assets sub-folder in the same section folder as the article, and use the following syntax to insert the link to the file in your article:

```
[asset_title](assets/%file_name%).
```

### Anchor links to sections

If you need reference a section inside your article, you don't need to create a separate anchor. Theyâ€™re automatically generated at publishing time for all H2-H6 headings. The anchors are generated from header by making all words lowercase and using "-" for separating words.

Example:

```markdown
## This is header
```

This is a link to this anchor:

```markdown
[this is link to the anchor in the same article](#this-is-header)`
```

## Tables

Use [HTML formatting for tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp).


## Warnings and info blocks

Success note block:
```
>[!SUCCESS]
>
>This is a success note
```
Warning block:
```
>[!WARNING]
>
>This is a warning
```

Info note block:
```
>[!INFO]
>
>This is a block with additional info
```

Error note block:
```
>[!ERROR]
>
>This is a block with additional info
```
